# Aim
To develop and evaluate a scenario-based prompt engineering approach using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Role-Based, and Multi-Modal prompting techniques for enhancing the reliability, empathy, and contextual awareness of the MediGuide Smart Health Assistant across diverse elderly healthcare scenarios..

## Objective:
To develop a scenario-based report demonstrating the use of diverse prompting strategies (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Role-Based, Multi-Modal) to optimize MediGuide's response quality across five use cases:
Medication Reminders Emotional Support
Health Monitoring Advice Crisis Situations
Understanding Visual Inputs (Multimodal)


# Algorithm:

Step 1: Identify the Use Case Choose a user scenario (e.g., reminding medicine, giving advice, responding to an emotional query).
Step 2: Select an Appropriate Prompt Type Match the complexity and context of the scenario to a suitable prompting strategy:
Zero-Shot Prompting for general tasksFew-Shot Prompting to teach the model using examples Chain-of-Thought Prompting for complex health reasoning Role-Based Prompting for empathy and engagement Multi-Modal Prompting when interpreting charts/images
Step 3: Construct the Prompt Design input prompts tailored for the selected use case and strategy.
Step 4: Generate Output using Al Model Use LLMs such as GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini to evaluate the responses.
Step 5: Evaluate the Output Assess each output based on:
 
# Accuracy Relevance
Tone (empathetic and senior-friendly) Coherence
  Output   Use Case 1: Medication Reminder Prompt Type: Zero-Shot Prompt: "Remind Mr. Sharma to take his blood pressure medicine at 8 AM and 8 PM every day." Output (ChatGPT):
"Hi Mr. Sharma! Just a friendly reminder to take your blood pressure medication now. It's 8 AM-staying on schedule keeps you feeling your best!"
  Use Case 2: Emotional Support Prompt Type: Role-Based Prompt Prompt: "You are a compassionate health assistant. A user says: 'I feel lonely these days."' Output (Claude):
"I'm really sorry to hear that. You're not alone-many people feel this way, and it's okay. Would you like me to share some relaxation exercises or connect you with a support group?"
  Use Case 3: Personalized Health Advice Prompt Type: Few-Shot Prompt:

# "Example 1:
User: 'My sugar levels are high today.' Al: 'Please avoid sugary snacks and stay hydrated. Consider going for a 15-minute walk.'
# Example 2:
User: 'My knee is hurting more than usual.' Al: Try applying a warm compress and avoid climbing stairs today.'
Now respond to: 'I have a slight headache this morning."' Output (Gemini):
"Try drinking a glass of water-it might be dehydration. If it persists, rest in a quiet room and avoid screens. Let me know if you feel better soon!"
  Use Case 4: Crisis Handling Prompt Type: Chain-of-Thought Prompt:

"A user with diabetes says: 'I'm feeling dizzy and sweaty.' Think step by step before replying."
 
Output (ChatGPT):

"Dizziness and sweating can be signs of low blood sugar. Ask them to sit down and check their sugar level if possible. If it's low, suggest they eat or drink something sweet like juice. If symptoms persist, call emergency services."
Use Case 5: Visual Input Interpretation Prompt Type: Multi-Modal Prompt:

"Look at the image of the glucose chart uploaded. Summarize the trend for the past week." (Image of glucose level graph attached)
Output (Gemini or GPT-4V):

"The chart shows that glucose levels peaked in the afternoons but dropped significantly at night. Average levels stayed slightly above normal, indicating the need to adjust meal timing or medication."

# Result
The prompting techniques were successfully applied to generate context-specific, empathetic, and helpful outputs for a smart health assistant system. Each technique demonstrated its strengths:

# Zero-shot:
Quick, generic responses.

# Few-shot: 
Pattern learning for custom advice.

# Chain-of-thought:
Reliable for reasoning during crises. Role-based: Empathy and human-like interaction.

# Multi-modal:
Rich insight from visual data.
